My practical exams are starting from **27th of may** and will be going on **till 6th of april 2024**. Then follows my *external exams* that beings from **15th of april till 25th** of the same 

And as I atleast need like 12 days for preping up for the external exams, meaning starting my study from **3rd of April** itself.

Meaning that I have to once again put on hold my data science persuation and being preparing for the externals, though I think I'll be able to complete the entire statistics syllabus, i.e I will be able to meet with [[March 2024 Target (Statistics)|this month's target]] before going off.

With This I would've completed everything in the foundational section of this course and I would be ready to step into the machine learning section of this course...
